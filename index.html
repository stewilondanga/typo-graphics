      What CSS property do you use to set the colour of a text block? If you said <em>color</em> you were … wrong!
    </p>
    <p class="intro">

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled <span>`ORANGE MARMALADE'</span>, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
